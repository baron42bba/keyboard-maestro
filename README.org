* Overview

This is my collection of [[http://www.keyboardmaestro.com][Keyboard Maestro]] macros.

* Macros
** [[file:Edit_Anywhere.kmmacros][Edit_Anywhere]]

copied from https://github.com/tjluoma/edit-anywhere.git.
Added support for Emacs.

** [[file:screen-start-ssh-to-clipboard.kmmacros][screen-start-ssh-to-clipboard]]

A small macro to bring iTerm2 to front. Assumed running GNU
Screen. Open a new tab and ssh to what's in clipboard.
I have a small Emacs function calling this macro.
That way I can open a connection outside of Emacs. Something I still
occasionally do.
